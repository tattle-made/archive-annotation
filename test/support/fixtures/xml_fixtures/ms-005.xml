      <p>The Ajith Kumarn Papers came to the Archives at NCBS through a donation by Kumar in Bangalore in early 2019. The Archives was, however, familiar with the material since it first came to know of it in 2016, and has used a digital copy of it over the years.</p>

      <p>Born in 1952, Ajith Kumar has been a pioneer in the field of wildlife biology in India. Kumar obtained a Master's in Zoology degree from the University of Kerala, Trivandrum, in 1974. He studied the ecology and population dynamics of lion-tailed macaques in the Western Ghats for a doctorate from Cambridge University. His research interests include the ecology of primates and small mammals in the Western Ghats and the Himalayas. He has been a faculty at the Wildlife Institute of India (Dehradun) and at the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (Coimbatore). He joined the Wildlife Conservation Society - India in 2003. As one of the core architects of the Masters in Wildlife Biology and Conservation program, hosted by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), the Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS) Bangalore, and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS-New York), Kumar has been an educator and mentor to dozens of wildlife biology students.</p>
